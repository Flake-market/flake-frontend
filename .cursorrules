<DESCRIPTION>
    ATN.fun is a platform on Solana that tokenizes attention.
    Attention represents the time and mental energy that an audience dedicates to consuming or interacting with content produced by individuals or organizations, such as influencers, content creators, brands, or advertisers.
    Humans have limited attention. There is an opportunity cost to the allocation of attention. It is scarce. It is valuable. It's a finite resourceâ€”individuals have a limited capacity for attention at any given moment. This scarcity makes attention a valuable commodity in today's information-rich environment.
    The tokenization of attention is the representation of attention in a token. The belief that the token holds a certain amount of attention.
    ATN.fun allows anyone to tokenize the attention of their audience, allowing anyone buy and speculate on them.
    The attention tokens bought can then be used to request for a sponsored post on the creator's social accounts - hence obtaining the attention of their audience.
    Buyers of attention can purchase attention tokens to make a request for a sponsored post or the expectation of profiting from the appreciation of the attention tokens - speculation on the growth of the creator's audience.
    Creators can sell their attention tokens via a bonding curve.
    When a request is made, the creator can choose to accept the request. Accepting it will burn the attention tokens via the same bonding curve and the funds will be deposited into the creator's account.
